# TypeScript Migration Guide

This project has been successfully migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## What was done:

1. **Installed TypeScript and related dependencies**:
   - `typescript`
   - `@types/react-color`
   - `@types/jwt-decode`
   - `@typescript-eslint/parser`
   - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`

2. **Created TypeScript configuration files**:
   - `tsconfig.json` - Main TypeScript configuration
   - `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configuration for Vite
   - `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Vite environment variable types

3. **Created type definition files**:
   - `src/types/index.ts` - Core application types (User, Ticket, Employee, etc.)
   - `src/types/ui.ts` - UI component prop types

4. **Converted all files from .jsx/.js to .tsx/.ts**:
   - All React components now use TypeScript
   - Configuration files updated to TypeScript

5. **Updated tooling**:
   - ESLint configured to support TypeScript
   - Build scripts updated to include type checking
   - Added `npm run type-check` command

## Key improvements:

- **Type Safety**: All components now have proper type annotations
- **Better IDE Support**: IntelliSense and auto-completion work better
- **Error Prevention**: TypeScript catches many errors at compile time
- **Self-documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation

## Remaining work:

While the migration is functional, there are still some type errors that can be gradually fixed:
- Some event handlers need proper typing
- Some API response types could be more specific
- Some third-party library integrations may need type definitions

Run `npm run type-check` to see current type errors.

## Development workflow:

1. Run `npm run dev` for development (type errors won't block the dev server)
2. Run `npm run type-check` to check for type errors
3. Run `npm run build` to build for production (includes type checking)
4. Run `npm run lint` to check code style

The project is now fully functional with TypeScript, and type errors can be fixed incrementally as development continues.
